# Alarm-Clock
This project is an Alarm Clock structured using HTML, styled using CSS and added functionality using Vanilla JavaScript. I have designed an analog clock as well as a digital clock. The analog clock is styled like a resin clock. With this, there is an alarm function where you can
* Set alarm using the set alarm button.
* Set multiple alarms using the set alarm button.
* Delete an alarm using the delete button.
* Set alarm in both AM and PM.
* You can stop the alarm using stop alarm button.
* You can see the alarms in the upcoming alarms section

# Function
You can set alarm using the input boxes as hours, minutes ,seconds , AM/PM respectively. As soon as you set the alarm, the alarm is added to the upcoming alarms section. When it is time to ring the alarm, there will be an alert box and then the alarm starts ringing with the audio given. You can stop the alarm using stop alarm button. You can delete it from the upcoming alarms section.I have also added the screenshot of the alarm clock for reference below.
