# Alarm-Clock
This project is an Alarm Clock structured using HTML, styled using CSS and added functionality using JavaScript. I have designed an analog clock as well as a digital clock. Along with this, there is a set alarm function where you can
* Set alarm using the set alarm button
* You can set multiple alarms using set alarm 
* You can delete an alarm using delete button
* This is not a 24-hour clock. You can set alarm in both AM and PM
* You can stop the alarm using stop alarm button
